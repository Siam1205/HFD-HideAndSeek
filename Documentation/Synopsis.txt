HSF-HideAndSeek is an LSB-based Steganography tool developed for the purpose of teaching. It implements Sequential as well as Randomized Hide & Seek algorithms in order to hide arbitrary files inside BMPs or 24-bit PNGs. Therefore, it allows to use 1 up to 7 of the carrier image's bit planes (although this is not recommended at all). In addition, HSF-HAS facilitates to encrypt the messages before hiding with AES256-CBC and allows the user to display bit planes of an image so that he may apply a visual attack to potentially generated stego images himself. Lastly, the tool supplies the possibility to rate an image regarding its suitability for a specific message. Such a rating can predict whether the generated stego image is robust against statistical attacks which is the case when the rating reaches 90%.
